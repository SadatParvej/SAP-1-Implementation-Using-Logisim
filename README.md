# SAP-1 Using Logisim (Combinational Logic Approach)
This project implements the **SAP-1 (Simple As Possible-1)** computer using **Logisim**. Instead of a traditional ROM-based control unit, this design uses **combinational logic** generated from Logisim's analysis tool.

## Features
- Control signal generation using **truth tables** and **combinational circuits**.
- No ROM-based microprogramming, making the design more hardware-efficient.
- Implements core SAP-1 instructions like **LDA, ADD, SUB, OUT, HLT**.
- Developed using **Logisim** for digital circuit simulation.
